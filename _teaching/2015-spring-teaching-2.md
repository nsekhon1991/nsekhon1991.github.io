Wrote a lesson plan for instructors at institutes of higher education to teach pertinent climate change topics using the example of the Maya Lowlands. Lesson plan is published online and available to the public. The results were published in *Journal of Geography in Higher Education.* The lesson plan was tested over two semesters where I was the guest instructor.
