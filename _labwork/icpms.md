Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) measures trace element concentrations of solids (in-situ) attached to a laser (LA-ICP-MS) or diluted water samples attached to a quadrupole (ICP-Q-MS). I have analyzed trace element (Mg, Ba, Sr, Fe, Cu, Zn) concentrations of modern stalagmites, cave calcite precipitate on plates, cave dripwaters and spring and stream waters.
A Multicollector-Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (MC-ICPMS) measures isotopic ratios of Uranium and Thorium that are used in stalagmite geochronology. I have prepared and analyzed tropical stalagmites for Uranium and Thorium ratios using a Neptune MC-ICP-MS at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities during my Masters.
