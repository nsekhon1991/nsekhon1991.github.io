Isotope Ration Mass Spectroscopy (IRMS) has the capacity to measure stable isotopic compositions of oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen to name a few. I've analyzed numerous carbonate (stalagmites, corals, forams, paleosols) and water samples with a Thermo Scientific MAT 253 IRMS attached to a KIEL IV, KIEL III, Gas Bench, and TCEA.
