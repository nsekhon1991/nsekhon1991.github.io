Isotope Ration Mass Spectroscopy (IRMS) has the capacity to measure stable isotopic compositions of oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen to name a few. I have prepared, analyzed a panoply of carbonate (stalagmites, corals, forams, paleosols) and water (cave dripwater, stream and spring water) samples with a Thermo Scientific MAT 253 IRMS attached to a KIEL IV, KIEL III, Gas Bench, and TCEA.
