I am an Assistant Professor in the Geology Department at Occidental College, CA, USA. Previously, I was a Voss Postdoctoral Research Associate and Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at Brown University working with Dr. Dan Ibarra and held a Research Affiliate position at MIT with Dr. David McGee.  I earned my Ph.D. and M.Sc. from the Jackson School of Geosciences at the University of Texas, Austin. Before that I studied Earth System Science (B.S.) at the University of California, Irvine and spent 8 months at the University of Edinburgh.

My scholarly pursuits are multidsciplinary and are primarily anchored to the disciplines of paleoclimatolgy, low-temperature (isotope) and trace-element geochemistry, and hydrology within karst landscapes. I focus on understanding mechanisms that
