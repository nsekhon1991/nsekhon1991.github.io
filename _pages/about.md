I am currently a [Voss Postdoctoral Research Associate](https://ibes.brown.edu/funding-opportunities/voss-postdoctoral-research-associate-environment-and-society) and [Presidential Diversity Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/institutional-diversity/initiatives/presidential-diversity-postdoctoral-fellowship) at Brown University working with [Dr. Dan Ibarra](https://sites.brown.edu/ibarra-lab/). I grew up in Punjab, India, lying within the foothills of the Himalayas where I became enamoured by the world around us. I earned my Ph.D. and M.Sc. from the [Jackson School of Geosciences](https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas, Austin. Before that I studied Earth System Science (B.S.) at the [University of California, Irvine](https://www.ess.uci.edu/) and spent 8 months at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences).  

My research primarly focuses on understanding mechanisms driving cycles of climate change in terrestrial environments. I am particularly interested in the interplay between floods and droughts in the present (1950s - Present), near-past (Quaternary), and future (circa 2100 CE) landscapes. I do so by analyzing traditional stable isotopes and trace element concentrations of stalagmites harvested from caves. The confidence in the interpretation of the geochemical trends of stalagmites (with age-uncertainties) is greater with a deeper understanding of the modern cave system. As such, I also monitor the physical and chemical parameters of cave systems to better understand what processes dictate the transfer of a climate signal to a chemical signal. 

For my postdoctoral work at Brown, I will be investigating tropical droughts in the Philippines and its impacts on the people. I will use satellite and archived data of river dishcarge and rainfall amount. A multi-proxy approach will also be taken on new stalagmites retrieved from the archipelago. Stay tuned for updates!

RESEARCH AREAS: Extreme events (droughts and floods), terrestrial (paleo)climate, low-temp geochemistry, stalagmites, cave monitoring, quaternary climate change, statistical and time-series analysis.
