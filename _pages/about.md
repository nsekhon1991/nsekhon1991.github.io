I am an Assistant Professor in the Geology Department at Occidental College, CA, USA. Previously, I was a Voss Postdoctoral Research Associate and Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at Brown University and held a Research Affiliate position at MIT with Dr. David McGee.  I earned my Ph.D. and M.Sc. from the Jackson School of Geosciences at the University of Texas, Austin. Before that I studied Earth System Science (B.S.) at the University of California, Irvine and spent 8 months at the University of Edinburgh.

My scholarly pursuits are anchored to the disciplines of terrestrial paleoclimatolgy, low-temperature (isotope) and trace-element geochemistry, and hydrology within karst landscapes. I focus on understanding mechanisms that drive changes in the terrestrial hydroclimate in the modern and through the Quarternary.  

RESEARCH AREAS: Extreme events (droughts and floods), terrestrial (paleo)climate, low-temp geochemistry, stalagmites, cave monitoring, quaternary climate change, statistical and time-series analysis.
