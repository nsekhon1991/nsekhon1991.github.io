I am currently a [Voss Postdoctoral Research Associate](https://ibes.brown.edu/funding-opportunities/voss-postdoctoral-research-associate-environment-and-society) and [Presidential Diversity Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/institutional-diversity/initiatives/presidential-diversity-postdoctoral-fellowship) at Brown University working with [Dr. Dan Ibarra](https://sites.brown.edu/ibarra-lab/). I grew up in Punjab, India, lying within the foothills of the Himalayas where I became enamoured by the world around us. I earned my Ph.D. and M.Sc. from the [Jackson School of Geosciences](https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas, Austin. Before that I studied Earth System Science (B.S.) at the University of California, Irvine and spent an year at the Univeersity of Edinburgh.  

My research primarly focuses on understanding mechanisms driving cycles of climate change in terrestrial environments. I am particularly interested in the interplay between floods and droughts in the present (1950s - Present), near-past (Quaternary), and future (circa 2100 CE) landscapes. Stalagmites that grI use geochemical signatures of stalagmites from drought sentivite regions such as New Mexico (Ph.D. work) a     

For my postdoctoral work at Brown, I will be deliving 

RESEARCH AREAS: Extreme events (droughts and floods), terrestrial (paleo)climate, low-temp geochemistry, stalagmites, cave monitoring, quaternary climate change
