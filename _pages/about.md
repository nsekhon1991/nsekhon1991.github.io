I am an Assistant Professor in the Geology Department at Occidental College, CA, USA. Previously, I was a Voss Postdoctoral Research Associate and Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at Brown University and held a Research Affiliate position at MIT.  I earned my Ph.D. and M.Sc. from the Jackson School of Geosciences at the University of Texas, Austin. I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of California, Irvine in Earth System Science (B.S.). During this time, I got to spend an year as an exchange student at the University of Edinburgh. 

My scholarly pursuits are anchored to the disciplines of terrestrial paleoclimatolgy, low-temperature (isotope) and trace-element geochemistry, and hydrology within karst landscapes. I focus on understanding mechanisms that drive changes in the terrestrial hydroclimate in the modern and through the Quarternary at seasonal to centinnial scales. I am particularliy interested in investigating drivers of extreme hydroclimate events such as floods and droughts in order to constrain future climate projections. I do so by looking at the geochemistry of stalagmite layers collected from cave systems and monitoring the meteorlogy and geochemistry of modern cave systems. I have been very fortunate to work along caving communities in the mid-latitutes and the tropics through close and continous partnerships.  

At Occidental College, I am the PI for the Water Isotopes, Cave and Karst (WICK) Lab. 

RESEARCH AREAS: Extreme events (droughts and floods), terrestrial (paleo)climate, low-temp geochemistry, stalagmites, cave monitoring, quaternary climate change, statistical and time-series analysis.
